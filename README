vfs_amazon_s3.

This is a work in progress. It is an experiment to see how well we can 
integrate Amazon's S3 with Samba via a VFS.

The idea is to allow a Samba share to be a place that you could use to drop
files into and then have them saved up on Amazon's S3 service as a backup for
you.

To build (against the master branch, or a 3.6.x branch with the FSCTL patches):

1. ./autogen.sh
2. ./configure --with-samba-source=/path/to/samba/source3/
3. make

You need to add the following fields to the share you want to have push files
up to Amazon's S3 service:

[the-share]
	path = /some/path
	vfs objects = vfs_amazon_s3
	vfs_amazon_s3:access key = your-access-key
	vfs_amazon_s3:secret key = your-secret-key
	vfs_amazon_s3:bucket = the-name-of-the-bucket
	vfs_amazon_s3:reloc dir = /path/to/some/dir/not/under/the/share

Yes, I know, the secret key needs to be dealt with in a better fashion.
