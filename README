vfs_amazon_s3.

This is a work in progress. It is an experiment to see how well we can 
integrate Amazon's S3 with Samba via a VFS.

The idea is to allow a Samba share to be a place that you could use to drop
files into and then have them saved up on Amazon's S3 service as a backup for
you.

To build:

1. ./autogen.sh
2. ./configure --with-samba-source=/path/to/samba/source3/
3. make
